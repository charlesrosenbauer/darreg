# DARREG GUI

This is a simple gui library for use in some Badger Labs projects.

It is named after Ivor Darreg, who was the microtonal musician who coined the term "Xenharmonic". It doesn't really have anything to do with GUIs or anything, it just seemed like a cool name and Darreg had some [interesting music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nG0T1t9WUY)



It is designed to be simple and fast, with no external dependencies beyond basic windowing libraries.

The API is also designed to be vaguely similar to HTML/CSS (though heavily simplified). Maybe that means someone will use it as a lighter-weight alternative to Electron or something.


Still a work in progress, though I may eventually add bindings for some other languages.
